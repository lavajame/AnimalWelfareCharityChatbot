> hi there - am thinking about getting a new dog but unsure what to look for - i have two teenage children and they are kind and like going on rambles in the country - and we live close to a park, so that's good. i do work 8am-6pm and the kids are at school in those hours so the dog would be on its own a lot. i also cannot afford much in way of vets bills, so can you consider this factor in selecting a dog please - what advice can you give me

Okay, let’s break down the costs of dog ownership for you with two teenagers and a limited time, considering your specific circumstances. It’s fantastic you’re thinking about this carefully – it’s a big commitment! Here’s a breakdown of what to expect, focusing on affordability and your lifestyle:

**1. Estimated Annual Costs (with your priorities in mind):**

*   **Food:** $200 - $500 (budget-friendly breeds, focusing on dry food is often cheaper)
*   **Vet Care (Routine):** $100 - $300 (This is where you’ll likely need to be flexible.  Early preventative care is *crucial* with a limited budget – vaccinations, parasite prevention, and a basic check-up).  Factor in potential emergencies – you’ll need a small buffer.
*   **Pet Supplies (Leash, collar, toys, bedding, etc.):** $50 - $150 (Start with the essentials, and build up as the dog grows).
*   **Training/Classes (Highly Recommended):** $50 - $150 (Focus on basic obedience and socialization, especially with teenagers.  These can be costly, but vital for a well-behaved dog).
*   **Grooming (If needed):** $50 - $100 (Daily brushing is a must for short-haired breeds, but occasional baths and nail trims).
*   **Dog Park Fees (If applicable):** $50 - $150 (Highly variable depending on the park.)


**Total Estimated Range: $550 - $1,100+** – this is a *rough estimate*, and can vary significantly based on breed, location, and your choices.

**2. Cost Considerations Given Your Lifestyle:**

*   **Time Constraints:** This is *critical*.  You're already working a full 8am-6pm schedule.  A dog will need dedicated time – walks, playtime, training – but it’s a limited amount.  **Don't overcommit.**
*   **Teenage Involvement:**  Your kids are involved, which is great!  But remember, they need to *learn* responsibility.  They need to understand that the dog needs consistent care and that they are responsible for the dog’s well-being.  **Start with basic training and socialization.**
*   **Limited Budget:**  Let’s be realistic.  **Focus on a smaller, lower-maintenance breed.**  Avoid fancy breeds or expensive accessories initially.

**3. Breed Recommendations (Considering your criteria):**

*   **Miniature/Toy Breeds:**  (8-15 lbs)  Generally less expensive, lower grooming needs, and can handle more independent play. Examples: Beagle, Cavalier King Charles Spaniel, French Bulldog (be careful with wrinkles!).
*   **Greyhounds:**  (55-70 lbs) Surprisingly low energy, but need a good walk each day.
*   **Poodles (Miniature & Toy):** Intelligent, relatively low-shedding, and can be trained.

**4.  Important Considerations – Reducing Costs:**

*   **Rescue/Adoption:**  Adopting from a rescue is usually *much* more affordable than buying from a breeder.  You’ll get a dog with a known history, and often, they’ll be looking for a loving home.  Be prepared for a bit of a commitment – they often need extra attention.
*   **Foster:**  Consider fostering a dog – you’re providing temporary care, and the dog can be permanently adopted if you like it.
*   **DIY:**  Get creative with training and enrichment.  Puzzle toys, short walks, and mental stimulation can keep your dog engaged without costly training classes.


**5.  Resources to Help You:**

*   **ASPCA (American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals):** [https://www.aspca.org/](https://www.aspca.org/) – Great for resources, breed information, and finding local shelters.
*   **Breed-Specific Rescue Organizations:** (e.g., Golden Retriever Rescue, Beagle Rescue) – Often have local resources and information.

**To help me give you even more tailored advice, could you tell me:**

*   What's your *absolute maximum* budget you’re comfortable with *per month* (including food, vet, and supplies)?
*   Are there any specific breeds you're leaning towards (even if it's just a general idea)?
