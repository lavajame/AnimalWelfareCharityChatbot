> hi there - am thinking about getting a new dog but unsure what to look for - i have two teenage children and they are kind and like going on rambles in the country - and we live close to a park, so that's good. i do work 8am-6pm and the kids are at school in those hours so the dog would be on its own a lot. i also cannot afford much in way of vets bills, so can you consider this factor in selecting a dog please - what advice can you give me

Okay, this is a great question – choosing a dog is a big decision, especially with your lifestyle and budget! Let’s break down what you need to consider, keeping in mind your limited time and resources. Here’s some advice tailored to your situation:

**1. Understanding Your Needs & Lifestyle – Prioritizing Low-Maintenance is Key**

* **Your Time is Precious:** You’re working a 8am-6pm shift, and the kids are at school. This means a dog needs to be relatively low-maintenance. Think about *how much* time you realistically have for walks, training, and playtime.
* **Teenage Children:** Their attention spans are shorter. A dog needs to be genuinely affectionate and responsive to *you*, not just someone who can entertain them.
* **Rural Setting:** Parks are fantastic, but also means the dog will be largely alone, which is a significant commitment.

**2. Dog Breed Recommendations (Considering Your Criteria)**

Given your situation, let's focus on breeds that are generally good for low-energy, independent dogs with a love for the outdoors:

* **Basset Hound:**  Low-energy, gentle, and adaptable to smaller spaces. They’re happy with short walks and plenty of time alone. Their lower energy levels make them a good fit for a busy schedule.
* **Corgi (Miniature or Standard):**  Active, but not overly demanding. They’re intelligent and trainable, enjoying walks and playtime. They’re also relatively low-maintenance in terms of grooming.
* **Basenji:** These dogs are independent and don't require a lot of attention. They enjoy short walks and are happy to spend time alone.

**3. Cost Considerations – Realistic Budgeting**

* **Initial Costs:** (approximate - prices can vary greatly)
    * **Initial Costs:** $500 - $1,500 (depending on breed and breeder) – Consider adopting from a rescue or shelter first to save on initial costs.
    * **Food:** $30 - $75/month (based on food type) - Budget this carefully, especially if you’re adopting.
    * **Treats/Toys:** $10 - $20/month – Small toys are key!
* **Ongoing Costs:**
    * **Vet Care:** *This is where you'll need to be cautious*.  Look for vets with reasonable rates and prioritize preventative care (vaccinations, parasite control).  *Estimate: $50-100/year*.
    * **Food:** $30 - $75/month (Again, consider a budget)
    * **Licensing & Registration:** $20-50/year (check local requirements)
    * **Pet Insurance (Highly Recommended):**  $30-100/month - This can be a huge benefit to have in case of emergencies.

**4.  Key Things to Focus On (Given Limited Budget & Time)**

* **Training:**  *Absolutely crucial*.  Even low-energy breeds need training – obedience, recall, and socialization.  Consider a short, focused training class. ($50-$100/class)
* **Exercise:** Short, frequent walks are better than long, infrequent ones. 15-20 minutes of focused activity is great.
* **Socialization:** Early socialization is vital for any dog, but especially for teenagers. 
* **Love & Attention:**  Your dogs will need your affection and attention, even if it’s short bursts.

**5. Resources to Explore**

* **ASPCA:** [https://www.aspca.org/](https://www.aspca.org/) - Offers breed information, adoption resources, and pet care tips.
* **Rescue Websites:** [https://www.rescuedogs.org/](https://www.rescuedogs.org/) -  You can find dogs needing homes.
* **Local Veterinarians:** Research vets in your area – look for reviews and see if they offer affordable services.

**To help me give you even more personalized advice, could you tell me:**

*   **What’s your approximate monthly budget for a dog, including food, vet care, and other supplies?** (A range is fine!)
*   **Are there any breeds you absolutely *don't* want?** (e.g., high-energy, prone to certain issues)
*   **What kind of activities do the kids enjoy that you'd like the dog to participate in?** (e.g., hiking, playing fetch, just being present)
