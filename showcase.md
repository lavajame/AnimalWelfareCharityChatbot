> hi there - am thinking about getting a new dog but unsure what to look for - i have two teenage children and they are kind and like going on rambles in the country - and we live close to a park, so that's good. i do work 8am-6pm and the kids are at school in those hours so the dog would be on its own a lot. i also cannot afford much in way of vets bills, so can you consider this factor in selecting a dog please - what advice can you give me

Hi there! It sounds like you're in a great position to find a dog that fits your lifestyle, but there are a few key factors to consider based on your situation. Here’s a breakdown of advice tailored to your needs:

---

### **1. Breeds That Fit Your Time Constraints**  
Since your dog will be alone for ~10 hours a day (8am–6pm), you’ll want a breed that:  
- **Thrives on independence** (not prone to separation anxiety).  
- **Requires minimal attention** during alone time.  
- **Is calm and adaptable** to being left alone.  

**Recommended Breeds**:  
- **Basset Hound** (calm, low-energy, and content alone).  
- **Corgi** (if you can manage their occasional high energy, but they’re generally independent).  
- **Labrador Retriever** (if you can provide regular walks, but they may need more attention).  
- **Poodle (Miniature or Toy)** (intelligent, low-energy, and can handle being alone with training).  

**Avoid**:  
- High-energy breeds (e.g., Border Collies, German Shepherds) that may become destructive if left alone.  
- Breeds prone to separation anxiety (e.g., some terriers or hounds).  

---

### **2. Managing Vet Costs**  
Since you mentioned limited budget for vet bills:  
- **Adopt from a rescue or shelter** (many dogs are already vaccinated and spayed/neutered).  
- **Choose a breed with fewer health issues** (e.g., Basset Hounds are generally healthy, while some breeds like Bulldogs may have genetic conditions).  
- **Prioritize basic care**:  
  - Use **budget-friendly food** (e.g., store-brand kibble or homemade meals with vet guidance).  
  - Use **automated feeders** (if affordable) to avoid daily trips to the store.  
  - **Spay/neuter** your dog early to reduce long-term costs.  

---

### **3. Leveraging Your Kids’ Energy and Outdoor Time**  
Your teenagers’ love for rambles is a plus! A dog that enjoys **outdoor activities** will thrive:  
- **Walks and hikes** are great for burning off energy and bonding.  
- **Dog parks** near your home (you mentioned a park is close) are ideal for socialization.  
- **Teens can help with training** and walks, which is a win-win for both you and the dog.  

---

### **4. Practical Tips for Your Situation**  
- **Train for alone time**: Crate training or a safe, cozy space can help your dog feel secure.  
- **Use a dog walker or pet sitter** for emergencies (if budget allows).  
- **Invest in a durable collar and ID tag** for safety.  
- **Check local shelters or rescue groups** for low-cost adoption programs (some offer free or subsidized vet care).  

---

### **5. Final Recommendations**  
- **Adopt a low-energy, independent breed** (e.g., Basset Hound, Poodle, or Corgi).  
- **Focus on adoption** to reduce costs and ensure the dog is already vetted.  
- **Plan for walks/hikes** to keep the dog active and engaged.  
- **Budget for basic needs** (food, shelter, and occasional vet visits).  

If you’re open to it, I can also help you find local rescue groups or shelters in your area! 🐾 Would you like suggestions for specific breeds or resources?
