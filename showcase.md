> hi there - am thinking about getting a new dog but unsure what to look for - i have two teenage children and they are kind and like going on rambles in the country - and we live close to a park, so that's good. i do work 8am-6pm and the kids are at school in those hours so the dog would be on its own a lot. i also cannot afford much in way of vets bills, so can you consider this factor in selecting a dog please - what advice can you give me

Thank you for sharing your situation! It sounds like you’re looking for a dog that fits your lifestyle, budget, and family dynamics. Here’s a tailored guide to help you choose the best dog for your needs:

---

### **Key Considerations for Your Situation**  
1. **Time Constraints**  
   - **Your schedule**: You’re away from 8am–6pm, leaving the dog alone for 10+ hours.  
   - **Solution**: Choose a **low-energy, independent breed** that can cope with being alone. Avoid high-energy or anxious breeds (e.g., Border Collies, Herding dogs).  
   - **Recommended Breeds**:  
     - **Basset Hound**: Calm, low-maintenance, and great for walks.  
     - **Corgi**: Friendly and adaptable, though they may need mental stimulation.  
     - **Labrador Retriever (if budget allows)**: Intelligent and social, but requires consistent attention.  

2. **Vet Costs**  
   - **Budget**: You mentioned limited funds, so prioritize **healthier breeds** with lower vet expenses.  
   - **Tips**:  
     - Opt for **mixed-breed dogs** (often healthier and cheaper to adopt).  
     - Adopt from a shelter or rescue to reduce initial costs (e.g., adoption fees, vaccinations).  
     - Choose a breed with **fewer genetic health issues** (e.g., Basset Hounds are generally healthy, though they may need regular ear care).  

3. **Family Dynamics**  
   - **Teenagers**: They can help with feeding or walks after school, but ensure the dog isn’t left alone for too long.  
   - **Rambles in the countryside**: A dog that enjoys walks and outdoor activities is ideal.  

4. **Space & Environment**  
   - **Living near a park**: Perfect for daily walks and exercise.  
   - **Small breed**: If you prefer a smaller dog, consider breeds like **Poodles** (low energy, hypoallergenic) or **Beagles** (affordable and friendly).  

---

### **Top Breeds for Your Needs**  
1. **Basset Hound**  
   - **Why**: Low energy, calm, and great for walks.  
   - **Cost**: Affordable food (e.g., $20–$50/month) and minimal vet costs if healthy.  
   - **Note**: They may need regular ear cleaning and are prone to obesity, so diet is key.  

2. **Mixed-Breed Dog (e.g., Rescue or Shelter)**  
   - **Why**: Often healthier, cheaper to adopt, and less likely to have genetic issues.  
   - **Cost**: Adoption fees (often $50–$200) + basic vet care.  

3. **Labrador Retriever (if budget allows)**  
   - **Why**: Friendly, social, and great for families.  
   - **Cost**: Higher initial costs but may qualify for low-cost programs or adoption.  

4. **Poodle (Miniature or Toy)**  
   - **Why**: Low energy, hypoallergenic, and easy to train.  
   - **Cost**: Moderate food costs and regular grooming.

### **Practical Tips**  
- **Adopt a Dog with a "Good" History**: Look for dogs that are calm, not prone to separation anxiety, and have been socialized.  
- **Budget for Basics**:  
  - **Food**: $20–$50/month for small breeds.  
  - **Vet Care**: Prioritize annual check-ups and vaccinations.  
  - **Toys**: Invest in durable items to keep the dog entertained when alone.  
- **Involve Your Kids**: Let them help with feeding or walks to build a bond and reduce your workload.  
- **Check for Local Rescues**: Many shelters offer low-cost adoption and spay/neuter programs.  

---

### **Final Recommendations**  
- **Avoid**: High-energy breeds (e.g., Border Collies), dogs prone to separation anxiety, or breeds with high vet costs (e.g., some purebreds).  
- **Prioritize**: A calm, low-energy dog with minimal health needs and a friendly temperament.  

If you’re open to it, **adopting from a rescue** could be a great option—many dogs are eager for a home and may already be trained or healthy. Let me know if you’d like help finding local shelters or breed-specific advice! 🐾
